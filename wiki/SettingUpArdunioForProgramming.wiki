5. To program the board a TTL RS232 connection is required. Here is an example with "programmer" used for the 4DGL displays. It is really just an FTDI USB to serial adaptor.

6. Hit "Verify" to generate a .Hex file for programming. Assuming the code compiled with no errors:

Power off the board.

Hit "Program"

When you see "Binary sketch size: ...." re-apply power to the board.
