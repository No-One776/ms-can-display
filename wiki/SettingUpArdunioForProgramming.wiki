1. Install the Ardunio IDE. Windows installer available here: http://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software

2. If your board has an 8Mhz crystal then you need to take the core files here:

If your board has a 16Mhz crystal then you need the core files from here:

3. Extract the core files into your Arduino IDE folder such that you have the following:

5. To program the board a TTL RS232 connection is required. Here is an example with "programmer" used for the 4DGL displays. It is really just an FTDI USB to serial adaptor.

7. Hit "Verify" to generate a .Hex file for programming. Assuming the code compiled with no errors:

8. Remove the connector for the ribbon cable to the OLED display. 

9. Power off the board.
